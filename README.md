consists of techniques that are typically applied to gain insight into a dataset before doing any formal modelling.  EDA helps us to uncover the underlying structure of the dataset, identify important variables, detect outliers and anomalies, and test underlying assumptions. With EDA, we identify relevant variables, their transformations, and interaction among variables with respect to the model we want to build. EDA uses techniques of statistical graphics but has a broader scope
